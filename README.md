# blockchain-ex
client/server program running with the simplified blockchain protocol

### target
To conduct some researches in the algorithms used to reach to consensus in the blockchain, thus we designed this small project 

### notices
1. we simplified the raw protocol of the blockchain, only keeping these data structures and protocols that have something to do with the consensus in a small distribution system, so, obviously, this program has nothing to do with bitcoin and something like that. And, actually, this program is for a homework project for distribution system. lol

2. the design of this program consists of 4 parts: peer discovery protocol, message exchange protocol, pow/pos system, management message system

3. feel free to use it :)
